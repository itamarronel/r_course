## Stroop Data Analysis

### Description:
This project, located in the `Week8/stroop_data` folder, analyzes reaction times and accuracy in a Stroop task.  
The data includes multiple conditions (e.g., congruent and incongruent) and tasks (e.g., word reading vs ink naming).

### Results:
- **Accuracy by condition:**  
  - Congruent: 95.2%  
  - Incongruent: 87.8%  

- **Reaction Time:**  
  - Congruent: Mean = 600 ms, SD = 120 ms  
  - Incongruent: Mean = 720 ms, SD = 140 ms  

### Structure:
- **Scripts:**  
  - Data preprocessing  
  - Descriptive statistics  
  - Inferential statistics  

- **Data:** Filtered and raw data files for Stroop analysis, stored in the same folder.

### Location:
`Week8/stroop_data`
